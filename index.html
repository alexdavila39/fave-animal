<h1> <ins>Random facts </ins></h1>

<p style="color:aliceblue;" >Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20 hours each day resting and sleeping. <br>
    They have few sweat glands so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day and <br>
    become more active at night when it is cooler.
    Lions have terrific night vision.<br>
     They are 6 times more sensitive to light than humans. <br>
    This gives them a distinct advantage over some prey species when hunting at night.
